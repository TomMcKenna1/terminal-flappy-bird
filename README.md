<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](https://github.com/TomMcKenna1/terminal-flappy-bird/blob/main/resources/terminal_flappy_bird_demo.gif)

Play a flappy bird game in your UNIX based terminal. Press the spacebar to flap your wings but avoid the walls! Try and get past as many pipes as you can without crashing.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The game is currently only supported on UNIX based systems. 
To play, follow the steps below. 

1. Clone the repo

   ```
2. Run the `main.elf` file
   ```sh
   ./main.elf
   ```
3. Press the `spacebar` key to start the game!

Alternatively, you can compile the source code yourself. All source files can be found in the `/src` directory
